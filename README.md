# Pose Based Gait Posture Classification

</div>
 
## Description   
ðŸ““ This project made with the Pytorch, Pytorch Lightning, Pytorch Video library.

This project implements the task of classifying different human gait posture, based on four different pose.

classification of ASD and non-ASD.

The whole procedure is divided into these steps:
1. use meidapipe to detect the pose, get the joint keypoint.
2. use the estimated joint keypoint location, to split the whole body into three different part, such as head, upper, lower.
3. feed different part video into 3D CNN network, get the final predict results.
4. try to fusion different part features, to get a better accuracy.

## Folder structure

# How to run

First, install dependencies   
```bash
# clone project   
git clone https://github.com/YourGithubName/deep-learning-project-template

# install project   
cd deep-learning-project-template 
pip install -e .   
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```   
 Next, navigate to any file and run it.   
 ```bash
# module folder
cd project

# run module (example: mnist as your main contribution)   
python lit_classifier_main.py    
```

## Experimental setup

## Docker  

We recommend using docker to build the training environment.

1. pull the official docker image, where release in the [pytorchlightning/pytorch_lightning](https://hub.docker.com/r/pytorchlightning/pytorch_lightning)

``` bash  
docker pull pytorchlightning/pytorch_lightning
```

2. create container.

``` bach  
docker run -itd -v $(pwd)/path:/path --gpus all --name container_name --shm-size 32g --ipc="host" <images:latest> bash 

```

3. enter the container and run the code.

``` bash  
docker exec -it container_name bash
```
